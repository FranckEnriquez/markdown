# Markdown Tutorial

HTML is the building block of the web. It's what allows the web browser to render text, lists, tables, headers, images and more to the screen. However, HTML can become verbose and tedious to work with. Markdown allows us to use an easy to read and write text-based syntax that gets automatically converted to HTML. I wanted to create a tutorial for people new to Markdown so they can get swiftly and comfortably working with Markdown.  

### Getting Started

There are two ways of following this tutorial. I highly recommend installing Jupyter Notebook and following the file entitled "Intro to Markdown.ipynb". Thankfully installing Jupyter Notebook is incredibly quickly and convenient. For instructions on installing Jupyter Notebook refer to the [installation documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you prefer not to go that route, you can refer to the tutorial written in markdown entitled "intro_to_markdown.md". Make sure to reference the raw markdown along with the rendered output on Github so you can match each raw markdown to output.
